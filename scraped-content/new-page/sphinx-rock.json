    "“Sphinx Rock—that dead, titanic face of cliff marking old and dread convulsion—that cliff which offered, doubtless, in grim days, to many an outlaw a survey of distant Hobart Town, and approach of military and police in pursuit. ”",
    "Sphinx Rock was also known as White Rock, and as Ape Rock. It is a large sandstone outcrop with a magnificent view. It’s quite possible that there was a strong Aboriginal connection to this rock. The first track to the rock was Sawmill Track. It offered a sweeping view from its flat top—that is over 100 square metres. Turn-of-the-century rustic hut owners used to meet up regularly at Sphinx Rock for a hut owners’ dance. What fun! A later track from the Springs to the Rock was used for firewood gathering for the Springs Hotel. This track was later subsumed into the Lenah Valley Track.",
    "“Amongst other places on Mount Wellington to which I should like to take a friend would be the towering mass of rock going by the name of “The Sphinx,” which can be reached easily in half an hour from the hotel.”"
