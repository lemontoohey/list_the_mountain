    "Sphinx Rock was also known as White Rock, and as Ape Rock. It is a large sandstone outcrop with a magnificent view. It’s quite possible that there was a strong Aboriginal connection to this rock. The first track to the rock was Sawmill Track. It offered a sweeping view from its flat top—that is over 100 square metres. Turn-of-the-century rustic hut owners used to meet up regularly at Sphinx Rock for a hut owners’ dance. What fun! A later track from the Springs to the Rock was used for firewood gathering for the Springs Hotel. This track was later subsumed into the Lenah Valley Track."
