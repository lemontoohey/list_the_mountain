    "In June 2023 ENSHRINE recast its Cultural Landscape Precinct  into a Representation for a Local Historic Landscape Precinct under Hobart’s new planning scheme: The Hobart Local Provisions Schedule.",
    "Below find our Representation #181 (in 3 parts), followed by a map and an animated version of the proposed precinct boundary, and below them the subsequent S35 Assessment Report. AT the foot is the Council’s encouraging Resolution effectively acknowledging the Precinct’s merit.",
    "The Representation will be discussed in the Tasmanian Planning Commission on July 9.",
    "Above: 4 minute video animating the layers of local historic heritage that informed the boundary.",
    "Response to Assessment RFIs",
    "In July 2024 ENSHRINE appeared as a representor in a hearing before the Tasmanian Planning Commission re the Hobart LPS. On August 18, The Commission  directed ENSHRINE to provide “a draft of a completed Table C6.3 of Appendix A of the Local Provisions Schedule Structure in the State Planning Provisions, which is required for a Local Historic Landscape Precinct as is proposed for an area of kunanyi/Mt Wellington, and accompanying mapping showing the proposed spatial application of a Local Historic Landscape Precinct overlay lodge its LHLP Amendment by August 4th.”",
    "ENSHRINE re-sent the documents above with minor corrections.",
    "The Hobart City Council response  argued for the Amendment to go through the process in the normal course after the LPS had been approved.",
    "The latest update will be on the Tasmanian Planning Commission’s Hearings page of their website."
