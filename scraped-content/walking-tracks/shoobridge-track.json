    "TRACK NOTES by John Cannon",
    "Shoobridge Track is a good example of the tracks created during the activity of the early 1930s linking Shoobridge Bend with the Lenah Valley Track. Contemporaneous to this was the now defunct Geoffrey Smith Track linking Shoobridge Bend to Sphinx Rock. Of course the lower section of Shoobridge Track intertwines with the North-South Track multi-use but designed as part of the network of mountain bike tracks created on the mountain over the past 20 years. Just below where the two tracks cross is the intriguing Octopus Tree whose roots are anchored around a large rock. On the other side of Shoobridge Track, a tree used to be labelled the Lightning Tree after having been struck by lightning."
