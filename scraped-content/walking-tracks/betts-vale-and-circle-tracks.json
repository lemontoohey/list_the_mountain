    "TRACK NOTES by John Cannon",
    "Betts Vale and Circle Tracks were two of numerous tracks that were either created or upgraded during the Depression of the early 1930s, when ten men were employed on them by the Hobart City Council. This track work followed the purchase of a considerable tract of land from the Cascade Brewery company. The Sawmill Track, and the now unmaintained Middle Island Track, bear signs of the company’s earlier activities in timber-getting, which date back to the early 1820s.",
    "The original alignment of the Springs end of the Lenah Valley Track (the top section of which was formerly known as the Tramway Track) was used for a similar utilitarian purpose."
