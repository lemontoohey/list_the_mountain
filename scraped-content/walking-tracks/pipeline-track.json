    "The 20-kilometre long Pipeline Track—the longest on the mountain—has much colonial waterworks infrastructure to admire, such as the stone aqueducts below Fern Tree, the steep siphon closer to Wellington Falls and the wishing well. It was cut on a very gentle gradient, so is also popular with cyclists and runners. The section just above Fern Tree used to have a special popularity of its own 100 years ago as the Bower Track. The Track’s proximity to Fern Tree, Silver Falls made it a go-to place with shelters and tables for picnics, and for many decades, strawberry feasts.",
