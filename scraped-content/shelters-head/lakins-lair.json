    "Fred Lakin, a well known member of the Hobart Walking Club, had an eponymous sandstone shelter near Junction Cabin.  Although it was an open shelter, a chimney was built in its side.  Unfortunately, the chimney collapsed in the 1990s.",
    "The shelter is also known as Balfe’s Burrow and Wellington’s Hut."
