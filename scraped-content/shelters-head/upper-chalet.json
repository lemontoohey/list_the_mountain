  "paragraphs": [
    "Two chalet-style shelters were built on the mountain road around the time of the road’s opening in the late 1930s: an Upper and a Lower chalet. The upper chalet had a thatched roof and was situated on a steep bend, which provided excellent views.  Extraordinarily, in 1960 it was destroyed not by fire nor by flood, but by twin blows of the mountain’s demolition power: a landslide caused by a flood."
