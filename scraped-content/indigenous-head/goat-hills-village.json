    "In the north east of the Park arise the Goat Hills, painted in the gallery above.",
    "In answer to an early WPMT survey, the Trust’s historian Anne McConnell corresponded with a Glenorchy resident named Richard Calitz who alerted Anne to the presence of evidence for shelters and also some last remaining artefacts in a distinctive, vegetated site surrounded by tall trees & ancient She oaks that he knew of in the Goat Hills. She recorded his observations in her Heritage Audit Focus on the Fringe for the WPMT in 2005. Calitz considered it the site of the muwinina village visited by the French naval officer Lt. Freycinet, who saw its campfire smoke from his ship on the river, and was rowed ashore, and came upon it."
