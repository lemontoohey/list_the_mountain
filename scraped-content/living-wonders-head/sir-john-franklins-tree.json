    "The mountain’s blue gum forest was never named, but certain tall trees within it have gained the additional distinction of being named.",
    "ENSHRINE is aware of two very large gums formerly standing in the Park named the Sir John Franklin Tree and Lady Jane Franklin Tree.",
    "John’s Tree stood in what is now Talosa Park. In the Melbourne Age, March 1856, this tree was estimated to be 300 feet in height. The diameter at the base was measured at 30 feet.",
    "The location of Jane’s tree is not precisely known, but was said to be just off Huon Road in the mountain’s foothills. The artist Marianne North mentions both trees in her work A Vision of Eden. She was reputed to have spent some time searching for Jane’s tree but was unable to locate it.",
    "ENSHRINE suggests that the location is of Some local heritage significance."
