    "The Park is home to an alpine-adapted lizard, the Southern Snow or Boulder cool Skink. Its scientific name Niveoscincus microlepidotus derives from the latin nivea = snow + neo-Latin scincus, a skink, with mikros = small + lepidotos = scaled, referring to the relatively small scales.",
    "This is a cold blooded creature adapted to the cold climate above about 1100 m.",
    "Restricted to Tasmania’s heath/rock, alpine boulder field and alpine heathland where a canopy is absent and all vegetation dense and low), it is naturally vulnerable and this rarity makes it culturally significant."
