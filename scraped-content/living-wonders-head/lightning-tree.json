    "The Romans deified and enclosed with fences places where lightning struck the earth. Similarly, the Lightning Tree is a monument to such an occasion.",
    "Standing on the mountain's eastern slope (on the Lenah Valley Track, not far from Sphinx Rock), a sign once attached to its trunk marked this significance for all who pass by:",
    "“This tree was struck by lightning on the 11th of December, 1986 and a large slab of wood was blasted off the tree and across the track. In this case it was raining and no fire occurred. Occasionally lightning strikes during dry thunderstorms and fires are started. This was the main cause of bushfires for hundreds of millions of years before humans evolved.”— A. Mount, Forestry Commission",
    "This signpost reflects our fascination with sky being brought to earth. On a grander scale, The Mountain represents the most successful growth of the earth, rising to meet the sky. Such a powerful image forms the spatial arena in which our lives unfold.",
    "The current state of the lightning tree is unknown to us. It used to be obvious along the Lenah Valley track, but we can no longer find it. Do you know? Contact us, please.",
    "Text abridged from Mount Wellington and the Sense of Place by Angus Barnes (UTAS 1992)"
