    "The place name Yellow Gully has passed out of usage and possibly even out of memory. Curiously, the Hodgman map includes a black spot putting the Gully right on the Lenah Valley Track. Lady Jane would have passed through it. What is it? Probably a reference to that mass of colour that a valley of wattles effuses in flower. It’s a harbinger of spring, best seen from a distance."
