    "Featherstone’s Cascades are a short distance above O’Grady’s Falls. They cascade about three metres over a wide, mossy cascade before funnelling into a narrower plunge into a small pool below. The lovely zig-zag track beside the cascade was opened in 1931. It was a very popular walk, but  the track leading to it is now disused. Well worth the effort required to reach them, they are one of five falls on Hodgman’s 1935 mountain park walk map."
