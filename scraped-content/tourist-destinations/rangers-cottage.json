    "Charles Gadd was the first ranger on Mt. Wellington and he lived in a cottage (the Ranger’s House) at the Springs, where he provided assistance to walkers, oversaw the erection and upgrading of infrastructure, and protected the natural values of the mountain. He also provided overnight shelter to walkers and assisted in rescues, such as during the tragic 1903 Go-As-You-Please race, in which two young men lost their lives.",
