    "The precis above was also reported: “He himself [Prout], for instance, sometimes felt when gazing on Mount Wellington a mental impression of its majestic beauty, while at other times its aspect was forced upon the mirror of his memory as if it were a model of leviathan ugliness.”",
    "J. S. Prout was prolific in Tasmania in the mid 1840s. His influence on Tasmanian painting during this time was striking. His portrayal of the mountain varies from a wildly romantic, picturesque aspect, through to simple backdrop to the city.",
    "In 1846 a Sydney Morning Herald review of John Skinner Prout's Tasmania Illustrated praised his painting of Mount Wellington (entitled The Female Factory, from Proctor's Quarry)"
