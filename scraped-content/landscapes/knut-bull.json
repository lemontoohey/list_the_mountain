    "Bull was the only professional landscape painter in Hobart during his time there (from 1849). The Melbourne Herald wrote in 1856: “We have received from the artist, Mr. Bull, of Hobarton, a very beautiful print, executed in London, from a painting made by him, and coloured in the most natural and delicate manner. It is a view of Hobarton, including the bay and city, with Mount Wellington in the background. The aerial perspective is remarkably good, and a nautical friend has pointed out to us the singular correctness and grace with which the shipping, and especially a sailing boat, are introduced. The true tone and sentiment of the Australian landscape have been rendered with marvellous fidelity, and a more agreeable ornament to an Australian room could not be selected.”"
