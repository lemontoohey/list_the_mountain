    "‘Born in Hobart in 1932, always loving drawing and painting, Patricia had a term at Art School aged seventeen. In 1961 she opened Hobart’s first commercial art gallery. She joined Max Angus’s Sunday painting group and the pair painted and exhibited together for the next sixty years, becoming famous as Tasmania’s foremost watercolour landscape painters. Patricia particularly loved painting untouched, wild bush with no sign of human activity. Many of her best paintings show the mountains, plains and buttongrass of the south-west. She fought to save Lake Pedder by painting it and holding exhibitions to bring its beauty to a wider audience. She painted in oils, acrylics and pastels as well as watercolour, and produced portraits, abstracts, still lifes and drawings as well as landscapes.’",
