    "A few small mining concerns operated for a short time on the mountain. Lime and gold were mined above the Hobart Waterworks. It is believed that no gold or other precious metals of any great value were found. Slate was split during the convict era  below the Junction Cabin area at Wiggins Slate quarry. Similarly, the quality was not great. The four photos above are from the Tasmanian Mail from the 1898 Mt Wellington gold mine.",
