  "paragraphs": [
    "Henry Woods had a cottage at the Springs from 1859 in which he and his wife lived. They raised a son and daughter in the hut too.",
    "From his cottage Mr Woods worked for Council as a park ranger keeping the tracks open and occasionally searching for lost walkers as well as maintaining the waterworks at the Springs. He was also employed maintaining the lower icehouse. At home he tended to his stock and edible plants and gardens, and walkers in his ‘Halfway house’.",
    "His Georgian-style cottage was built on the upper slopes of the Springs and overlooked Hobart. It had vertical plank-walls and shingle hip roofed, cottage with a stone chimney at the north end.",
    "Gradually, he added outbuildings: barn/stables, a shelter shed, and a large log cabin-style structure with a gable roof of planks and a window and door at the north side), below and south of the house for storing ice made higher up before conveying it down to town on donkeys. A small walkers overnight accomodation extension, was likely built to the north of the cottage.",
    "Irene Schaffer has written more about Henry Woods."
