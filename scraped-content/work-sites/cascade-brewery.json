    "The Cascade Brewery was built to capture the pure mountain waters  gushing  from the heights of the mountain, and the company owned a large swathe of the Cascade valley, slopes and forested flanks all the way to the Pinnacle until around 1930. The company still owns land on the lower slopes and continues to use icy mountain water in some of its operations.",
    "To celebrate its bicentenary birthday in 2024 Cascade released a ‘Premium Source’ lager ‘to toast two centuries of endurance, innovation and the spirit of Tasmania’, according to the media release. Described as ‘Beer at its Peak’, Cascade Origin was promoted as made exclusively with water from kunyani/Mt Wellington. Cascade Brewery’s Head of Manufacturing Brendan Flanagan said the brew “celebrates the crisp water of kunyani, the highest grade Tasmanian cool-climate hops, locally malted barley and a commitment to quality. It has that little bit extra to make it really special.” The brew is sold in cases ($96) and six packs ($30) at selected venues in Hobart and Tasmanian bottle shops."
