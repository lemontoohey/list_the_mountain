    "This was the very first recreational hut on the Mountain and as such is highly significant. It is unnamed, but is locally referred to as the 1888 hut.",
    "It was built 1887-8. A simple but solid, almost square hut of horizontal logs, about ten feet by ten, with a bark roof and a low stone chimney.",
    "One of the members was Charles B. Pitman, possibly a relative of T. A. Pitman who became ranger on Mount Wellington between 1908 and 1916. Another member, named Freeny, is shown reclining on the log in one of the photographs.",
