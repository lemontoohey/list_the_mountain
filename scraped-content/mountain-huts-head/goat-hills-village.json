    "The land around and including the Mountain was shared between the South East Tribes, whose nation ranged from Storm Bay and the D’Entrecasteaux Channel (including Bruny Island) to South Cape, to New Norfolk and to the Huon Valley. For the Muwinina bands, the mountain was on their country. Sandstone rock shelters on the mountain and stone artefacts in the foothills are visible reminders of their experience.  Richard Calitz noted the presence of Aboriginal shelters with artefacts, and vegetation (tall trees & ancient she-oaks) on this sunny, eastern hillside. The presence of a village on the mountain is also attested by the French sailor Freycinet, who came upon one by accident, in the Goat Hills."
