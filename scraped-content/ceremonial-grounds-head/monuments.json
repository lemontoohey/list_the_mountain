    "The cast plaques for all the Councillors and Government Ministers who rolled up their sleeves and helped cut the roadway to the Pinnacle during the Great Depression of 1936. Below the names of the dignitaries responsible for the opening of the road to the Pinnacle, is a plaque commemorating the workers:",
    "“This tablet was erected to commemorate the achievement of the men who laboured under difficult conditions on the construction of the Pinnacle Road, planned and supervised by the officers of the Public Works Department and built by the Government of Tasmania in association with the Hobart City Council. 1934-1936.”",
    "In 1862 John Gillon and his team completed a stone dam and sluice house at Fern Tree Bower to intercept the water from Browns River and divert it into the Hobart water supply. A sandstone plaque at the Bower celebrates the opening of the Bower waterworks, which occurred during the tenure of Mayor Henry Cook, 1861.  In 1960 the Monument was washed downstream in a huge flood, but it was later reinstated in a slightly different location."
