    "Hang-gliding and paragliding enthusiasts are rare birds. The mountain is for the flying elite—and even for them, freakishly calm weather conditions are required for launch, but once you’re off the Pinnacle launch area near Big Bend the glide down to Cascade Gardens over the Organ Pipes is an unforgettable adventure.  Some aerialists have managed to fly as far as the Huon Valley. Many have reported eagle wingmen—and videos capture such close encounters.",
    "The earliest hang glider flights were in the 1990s, but the idea of gliding from the Pinnacle can be traced back to the 1930s. It did not seem to have actually happened in that era. A purpose-built hang-gliding launch ramp was proposed as part of the MWCC Pinnacle Centre facilities in 2019.",
    "SIGNIFICANCE",
    "The number of flights is few, but the cultural significance is high because the activity is emblematic of adventure, risk, height and its association with the talismanic eagles. There is also an association with the terrible attraction of the sublime."
