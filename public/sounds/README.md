# Page transition sound

Place **snow-step.mp3** in this folder for the navigation transition sound.

- The app expects: `public/sounds/snow-step.mp3` (played at 40% volume on route change).
- Use a short, subtle footstep or snow-crunch clip (e.g. 0.5–2 seconds).
- Free sources: [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org), [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/), or your own recording.
