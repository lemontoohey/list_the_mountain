    "This lookout was discovered by the family of council clerk A. W. (Cecil) Johnston. His boys write: “One day we started a Mt Wellington. We started about 9’ oclock in the morning, we walked up the Cascades. we arrived at the White rock without any adventure. We dined and wishing to explore we went into the bush, after a long walk we came to an enormous Rock which we call “Johnston’s” Lookout. We put placards on the trees and returned home.”"
