    "“A lot of the people could see kunanyi from where they lived. They stood on the Mountain looking down as the Hobart settlement grew, as they saw the boats come, as they saw the city develop, and they had to run and hide for their lives, and fight back for their lives against an irreversible tide.”",
    "An image of Bowen’s arrival, not Collins. Lieutenant John Bowen and party arriving at Risdon [AUTAS001139592174]",
    "The Muwinina people lived below the Mountain; they were a coastal people, and they did not migrate. Everything was available there for them. But they are known to have run to the Mountain seeking refuge—the protection of its hidden depths—as well as because it offered a lookout on all that was happening below.",
    "Wooreddy, a leader of the Nuennone band from Bruny Island, told George Augustus Robinson that:",

    "Janice Ross described a painting she made on the Mountain in 2018: “From the top of the mountain I look out across the waters and sense the story of kunanyi. Robinson's journals tell us our Ancestors thought the boats were white spirits in the distance, falling from the clouds into the water. The three distant white clouds that touch the water represent the first fleet of ships that arrived. We could be heard calling out on a quiet day to the cave across the water."
