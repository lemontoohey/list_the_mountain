    "“The winter sport of skiing was gaining in popularity among Club members, and the road to the pinnacle was providing access to areas suitable for ski runs. occasional blizzard conditions emphasized the need for some kind of shelter and in 1938 the City Council was approached once more with a view to interesting it not only in permission for a hut but also for the clearing of a public ski run.... The gentler sex joined in digging suitable dolerite boulders for the walls out of wet, black mud and hauling them from far and near to the site. “Master masons” stacked the rocks in place and cemented up the cracks. Iron for the roof was obtained from the line of roadmen’s huts which had housed the builders of the Mountain Road. In fact, some occupants were still in residence, as one over-enthusiastic member found when she suddenly unroofed somebody’s bedroom.The hut was fitted out with a window, door, bench and 44-gallon drum fireplace.”",
    "The Wellington Club had a ski hut near the Pinnacle. Built around 1940, not long after the completion of Pinnacle Road. Members overnighted in it after a hard day’s skiing. The Hobart Walking Club also built a ski hut-Luckmans Hut. There are also reports of a ski hut near Bracken Lane in the early 1900s, but nothing is known of it.",
    "Each run (four were made) was cleared by hand of boulders and trees. Cross-country courses  may also have been taken.",
    "See also Adventure Playgrounds."
