    "One of the more elaborate huts, and the last to exist.",
    "…a garden with rustic seats and flower pots made from fern roots … Crockery, teapots, and kettles … a place for picnics …",
    "It was built some time during the 1890s, before 1896.",
    "Clematis Hut was one of many which featured on postcards between 1895 and 1920.",
    "The hut was burnt down in 1909 but rebuilt immediately afterwards by its enthusiastic members. According to Roy Davies, this second version survived longer than any of the other huts.",
    "“We go on to a wonderfully constructed summer house, and looking down see a dear little “hut.” This is named “Clematis Hut,” it is all rustic work, the walls are made of small saplings placed closely together, it is roofed with bark, has a verandah running round, floor of saplings, on the verandah are rustic seats, all the curves and turns of the wood which form those seats being natural. The same may be said of the decorations round the top of the verandah. These twirling designs are not made, but are grown as they are the roots of trees, which have been patiently hunted for until the required shapes are found by the builders. The grounds around are very picturesque, and tree ferns are seen in them, under which more pretty rustic seats are placed.”",
    "McConnell assessed this hut as having Medium-High local significance, Some state significance individually and as part of the suite and Some national significance.",
