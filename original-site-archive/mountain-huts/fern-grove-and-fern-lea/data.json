    "The Fernlea hut was built c. 1905. A collapse of the balcony was reported in 1905, due to a large party enjoying themselves there, but nobody was seriously injured. Fernlea was replaced by Fern Grove  in 1907-8. Built by the Fernlea crowd, it was  a distance up the same gully. The design was modelled after a double decker tram. A nice photo appeared in the Sydney Mail in 1911.",
