    "This hut was constructed by the water-hunting surveyor Norman Hutchison and appears on his famous mountain map [detail above]. It was later dubbed Thark Hut after a popular play of that name by Ben Travers. It lasted until (but did not survive) the 1967 bushfire—long enough to be frequently used by the Hobart Walking Club.",
