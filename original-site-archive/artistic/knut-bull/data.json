    "“A more agreeable ornament to an Australian room could not be selected.”",
    "Bull was the only professional landscape painter in Hobart during his time there (from 1849). The Melbourne Herald wrote in 1856: “We have received from the artist, Mr. Bull, of Hobarton, a very beautiful print, executed in London, from a painting made by him, and coloured in the most natural and delicate manner. It is a view of Hobarton, including the bay and city, with Mount Wellington in the background. The aerial perspective is remarkably good, and a nautical friend has pointed out to us the singular correctness and grace with which the shipping, and especially a sailing boat, are introduced. The true tone and sentiment of the Australian landscape have been rendered with marvellous fidelity, and a more agreeable ornament to an Australian room could not be selected.”"
