    "“Though the city itself has changed over and over again the mountain remains the permanent link between past and present.”",
    "ENSHRINE’s proposed heritage nominations do not come from nowhere. The path to heritage recognition began in 1900 and piece by piece, chronicled in The Invisible Mountain has grown longer ever since.",
    "Heritage significance is strongly informed by its history— every heritage place has a history. The great general history of the mountain is Elizabeth de Quincy’s 1986 work The History of Mount Wellington. Anne McConnell prepared a historical sketch with a focus on heritage places in 2010. ENSHRINE  prepared a “Mountain Chronology”.",
    "Heritage nominations require maps that delineate the boundary of the heritage place. This contemporary mapping (as well as heritage research) is informed by historic maps of the mountain and its features, both of which can be viewed here.",
    "Heritage claims must be based on evidence. Evidence must be demonstrable and authorative. Throughout this website we refer to a wide range of authorities. Our sources are shown in full via the References icon below."
