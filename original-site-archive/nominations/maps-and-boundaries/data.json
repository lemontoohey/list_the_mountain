    "“By landscape, I mean the view, the physical and human view as well as the presence of the mountain, including its sounds. Together it is a Cultural Landscape to me as an Aboriginal person.”",

    "In 2005 the Wellington Park Management Trust published Volume 1 of Focus on the Fringe. In that publication is a map (Figure 2, page 31) sketching 14 High Sensitivity Historic Heritage Areas. They are spread through the Park, but with half of them (7) in the Hobart Local Government Area. Glenorchy LGA has 2 and Derwent Valley LGA 2. The Central Plateau Area falls on top of all three. The report states that all 14 have high heritage sensitivity, but are poorly understood. A map showing all 14 areas is reproduced below."
