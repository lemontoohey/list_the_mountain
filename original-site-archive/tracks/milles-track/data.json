    "Milles Track runs from the Springs towards the Wellington Falls Track.",
    "In 1831 a reservoir was constructed at the Cascades. To augment the water supply needed to fill the reservoir, water was diverted from Browns River near the Springs via a cut channel to flow instead into the Hobart Rivulet. Sections of this channel can still be seen along the north-western side of Milles Track. The track itself was named for R. S. Milles, who was the Director of Waterworks.",
    "Together with the Wellington Falls track, and as part of the historic track network, this track is of high state significance.",
    "In 2018 the Park’s trustees agreed to nominate Mills Track (WPHH0188) to the Tasmanian Heritage register as a priority place, principally because of its association with the Wellington Falls Track."
