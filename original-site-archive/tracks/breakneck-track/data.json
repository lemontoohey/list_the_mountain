    "Breakneck track is of more recent ‘upgrading’ as part of the network of fire trails put in after the disastrous 1967 bushfires. However, there had already been a significant network of tracks accessing a number of recreational huts built in the area from the early 1900s. These were then accessed by way of the obsolete McRobies Track, which went through the (now) tip area. Breakneck Track makes a fairly headlong descent from below Junction Cabin to the Boundary Fire Trail, going past the historic 1832 Wiggins slate quarry, whose slate was far from the highest quality."
